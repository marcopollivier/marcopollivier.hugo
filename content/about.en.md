### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hi. My name is Marco Ollivier.

I have a degree in Systems Analysis from the Infnet Institute in Rio de Janeiro.

I have been working with software development since 2010 and currently,
I'm working at [Flash](https://www.flashapp.com.br/) as a Lead Software Engineer.

### Projetos para comunidade

#### GopheRio

I am also one of the organizers of the GopherRio Meetup aimed at the Go developer community in Rio de Janeiro
In 2019 I decided to get more involved in the Software Development Community and with two friends,
[@caioeverest](https://github.com/caioeverest) and [@solivaf](https://github.com/solivaf),
we redesigned the Golang users group in Rio de Janeiro city.
The [GopheRio](https://www.meetup.com/GopheRio) was a great achievement for us and the developers community in Rio.
